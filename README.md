Homework 9 - Final Project

Instructions: Run Game2048.java

I did not receive any help outside of TA office hours. I did not collaborate with
anyone, and I did not use any resources beyond the standard course materials.

Board.java
Creates a representation of the 2048 Board as a 2D array. Handles all board
operations, checks for wins and losses, and contains methods that draw the win and
loss messages.

Tile.java
Creates Tile objects that represent the up to 16 individual tiles that populate the
Board.

Game2048.java
Runs Board and Tile to execute a 2048 game. This file is where the program is run and
the simulation is activated.

Thanks for the opportunity to create this project as the final assignment in this
class. I really enjoyed my time in CIS110 and even though I had already encountered a
lot of the material in high school, it was helpful revisiting and enriching my
experience. This was a time consuming, yet fun project. I look forward to taking more
CIS classes at Penn in the future :)
